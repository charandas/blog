I am Charandas Batra living in beautiful South Portland, Maine. I love all sorts of things
including Software Engineering, Reading, Fake News (haha), art, culture, spirituality. Here, I will
take the liberty of jotting down some of my musings and learnings.

Hope someone can benefit or be amused by my posts. Don't hesitate to write to me
if you have a question or two about the content.
